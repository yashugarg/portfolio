A flutter based app to initiate and participate in silent virtual auctions to easily sell off collectibles, antiques, etc.
Users can add Products to schedule and initiate auctions. The option to put items up for auctions allows users to bid on the product and the highest bidder wins. A Quick Sell Price can be set to sell the product directly without bidding. Users can resell items directly thorugh the app without going through the hassle of reuploading images and putting relevant information.
